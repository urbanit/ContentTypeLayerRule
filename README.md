ContentTypeLayerRule
====================

An Orchard CMS Module that adds a Content Type Layer Rule to your Orchard website. The original code was written by Sebastien Ros for Orchard 1.7 and I extracted the code so it can be used in Orchard 1.6.

When enabled you have the ability to use the "contenttype" rule when defining rules in your Orchard Layers.

For example, the rule contenttype("BlogPost") would specify that the widgets in the layer are only visible when a Blog Post is displayed in Detail. The rule contenttype("Page") would specify that the widgets in the layer are only visible when a Page is displayed in Detail.

For more information, you can read the following blog post.

You can find the module in the [Orchard Gallery](https://gallery.orchardproject.net/List/Modules/Orchard.Module.Sunkist.ContentTypeLayerRule).
